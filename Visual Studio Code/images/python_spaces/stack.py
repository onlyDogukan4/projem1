 Question 2: There are two tasks.
Task-1: Implement a stack data structure: Your stack should support the following operations:
opush(item): Adds the given item to the top of the stack.
opop(): Removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.
opeek(): Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
oisEmpty(): Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
osize(): Returns the number of elements in the stack. 
Task-2: Evaluate Postfix Expressions: Implement a method in any programming language that takes a postfix expression as a string and evaluates it using the implemented stack. The postfix expression consists of operands and operators separated by spaces. The operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The operands are non-negative integers.
